# Trace-Diff

## Procedure
The idea behind this tool is to compare and contrast several runs on the same program grouped to two groups.
Each group contains trace of the program in two different states, this can be used to correlate user input, for example, to the program's flow. It uses several runs of the same behavior to normalize any variations that may be in the flow.
